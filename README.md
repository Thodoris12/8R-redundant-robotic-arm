# 8R redundant robotic arm
Kinematic Control of Redundant Manipulator

MATLAB simulation of robotic arm with 8 rotational joints. The algorithm is based on the method of task decomposition.
-The first task is the path that the end-effector has to follow
-The second task is to avoid two obstacles in the cartesian space by minimizing a distance function.
